"Predicting the Likelihood of COVID-19 Infection Based on Symptoms and Demographic Factors"

This project aims to develop a supervised classification model to predict whether a person is likely to test positive for COVID-19 using symptoms (like cough, fever, sore throat, shortness of breath, and headache) and other potential influencing factors such as age group (above 60), gender, known contact history, and test date.

The primary objective is:

To identify the most significant predictors of COVID-19 infection.
To provide early indicators for health workers or screening systems to prioritize testing and isolation protocols.
To analyze trends in infections based on symptoms, demographics, and time.
